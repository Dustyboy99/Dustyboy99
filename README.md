## My process
This was a lovley challange to start with! I had to google a few tings to emind myself about syntax and such.
 I had a lot of issues with remembering how to move images ontop of a containter, however I managed to get the job
 done using margins and heights (Im not sure if I did this the most effective way possible...)

### Built with
VS code 
google fonts


### What I learned
I learned about what I already know! I tend to google before challenging myself with what I already know about code. 
It was very satisfying to see my training coming into play!


### Continued development
I want to start making the code cleaner and more stream lined, there are probably better ways to accomplish what I have 
done with this challange and I would love to know how to make things happen faster and less complicated.
